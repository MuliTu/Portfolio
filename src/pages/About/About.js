                    During my studies, I developed a passion for Front End Web development. Coding became my hobby as I
                    was striving to learn more. I strongly believe passion for the subject is the basis to achieve
                    excellence.

                    I would welcome opportunity to bring my skills to real projects. Ideally I wish to become valuable
                    asset for busy web agency. I am open to discuss my potential candidacy for both permanent and
                    temporary role. So get in touch now and see what I can bring to your projects.
